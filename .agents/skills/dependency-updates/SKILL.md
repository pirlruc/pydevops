# Dependency updates (SC-DEP-*)

Governs `.github/dependabot.yml` (and `.yaml`). Cite Guardrail IDs from
[`docs/guardrails/supply-chain/`](https://github.com/pirlruc/guardrails/tree/1.9.0/supply-chain).
Cadence and open-PR limit come from `docs/guardrails/supply-chain/profile.thresholds.yml` — do not bake numbers
into this rule.

Process companion:
[dependency-updates.md](https://github.com/pirlruc/methodologies/blob/1.8.0/github-issue-adr/docs/process/dependency-updates.md).

## Required shape

- **SC-DEP-001** — One `updates` entry for every package ecosystem present (always include `github-actions`).
- **SC-DEP-002** — Single PR per repo via top-level `multi-ecosystem-groups` and `multi-ecosystem-group` on each entry.
- **SC-DEP-003** — Interval and blocked-semver policy from the thresholds file; allow major, minor, and patch
  (no `ignore` that drops a semver level without a recorded deviation).

```yaml
version: 2

multi-ecosystem-groups:
  all-dependencies:
    schedule:
      interval: monthly   # from profile.thresholds.yml
      time: "06:00"
      timezone: Europe/Lisbon
    commit-message:
      prefix: build
      include: scope

updates:
  - package-ecosystem: github-actions
    directory: /
    patterns: ["*"]
    multi-ecosystem-group: all-dependencies
```

## Multi-ecosystem rules

- `patterns` is **mandatory** on every entry that joins a multi-ecosystem group; use `["*"]` for all deps.
- **Group-only** (set under `multi-ecosystem-groups`, never per ecosystem): `schedule`, `commit-message`,
  `target-branch`, `milestone`, `pull-request-branch-name`.
- **Additive** across group and ecosystem: `assignees`, `labels`.
- Prefer `commit-message.prefix: build` with `include: scope` so titles match Conventional Commits
  (`build(deps): …`).
- Prefer the uniform multi-ecosystem shape even when only one ecosystem exists — adding docker/uv later stays trivial.

## Private access (personal accounts)

Org **Grant Dependabot access** is org-only. On a personal account:

1. Fine-grained PAT with Contents: Read on every private repo Dependabot clones — **including submodules**
   and private reusable-workflow hosts, not only package deps.
2. Store as a **Dependabot** secret (Settings → Secrets and variables → Dependabot),
   not an Actions secret. Actions jobs cannot read Dependabot secrets. Wire
   top-level `registries:` `type: git`.
3. For private OCI (e.g. `dhi.io`), Dependabot `DOCKERHUB_*` secrets + `type: docker-registry`.
4. Keep the seed's `registries:` block **commented** until those secrets exist.
   Uncommented stubs fail Dependabot closed for every consumer.
5. Seed comments: [dependabot.example.yml](https://github.com/pirlruc/github-scaffold/blob/main/templates/dependabot.example.yml).

## Migration and verification

1. Close stale per-ecosystem Dependabot PRs before expecting the grouped PR (open-PR limit).
2. Merge to the default branch; touch `dependabot.yml` to re-trigger if needed.
3. Confirm `build(deps): … all-dependencies …` or Insights → Dependabot; record in handoff.
4. Pilot: [pirlruc/gitlab-mcp](https://github.com/pirlruc/gitlab-mcp).

## CI interaction

Skip jobs that need **Actions** secrets when `github.event.pull_request.user.login == 'dependabot[bot]'`. Do not compare `github.actor`.
([CI-024](https://github.com/pirlruc/guardrails/blob/1.9.0/ci/guardrails.md)). Dependabot secrets are for
version updates only.

## Do not

- Use per-ecosystem `groups:` as a substitute for `multi-ecosystem-groups` when the goal is one PR per repo.
- Add `ignore` rules that exclude major, minor, or patch without a `docs/guardrail-deviations.yml` entry citing
  `SC-DEP-003`.
- Overwrite a consumer's existing `.github/dependabot.yml` from sync — the scaffold seeds it once
  (`templates/dependabot.example.yml`).
